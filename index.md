## Welcome to Dr. Vinit Kumar's e-Classroom

This page is desgined to share the course material, interesting videos, websites and further readings to the students of Department of Library and Information Science, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow. It is one of the ways to implement technology in the classroom teaching. Basically, it follows _blended learning approach_ where the students are expected to come in the classroom with a _pre-reading_ of text, video and other learning materials. This helps them in forming a good background knolwedge on the topics to be coovered in the class and also help them in understanding the topics during the class. Some post-class materials lijke lecture notes, powerpoint presentations will also be shared. 

**Happy Learning!**
